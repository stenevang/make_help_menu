# Automatically generate a package help menu
#
# Based on .Rd files found in the /man/ folder of the package source,
# this function will generate a .R-file named like the package, with roxygen 
# notation that links to all files found in the /man/ folder. The effect is 
# that package users will get a menu to all help documentation in the package by
# typing ?<package> \cr
# The function \code{make_help_menu} is general and can be moved into any 
# package without modification.\cr
# WARNING! \code{make_help_menu} will generate a file named like <package>.R and
# therefore you MUST NOT put any of the package source in a file named like 
# that.\cr
# The function is not exported since it is meant to be used by package 
# developers only.
#
# @param man_dir The path to the /man/ directory where .Rd files can be listed.
# Default assumes the current working directory is the root of the package
# source, and specifies the /man/ subdirectory.
# @param R_dir The path to the /R/ directory where <package>.R can be saved. 
# Default assumes the current working directory is the root of the package 
# source, and specifies the /R/ subdirectory.
#
# @examples
#
# # start by opening the package project
# # then do:
# <package>:::make_help_menu()
# # where you replace <package> with the name of your package
# # then do ctrl+shift+B or re-install the package some other way
